MERN =>
    M => MongoDB (Database)
    E => Express (Backend)
    R => React (Frontend)
    N => Node.js (Backend)

Using Backend provides protection to hide sensitive data from DB.

JWT => JSON Web Token
When the client sends request for any endpoint, then it sends JWT token along with the request. Server can authenticate the user based on this token.
Initally client send full credentials of the user and then server sends this JWT token back to the client.

This is helpful in case of conditional rendering of components in frontend. We can also show/hide components based on whether user is logged in or not.

The JWT contains 3 parts =>
    1. Header => Contains the algorithm used for the JWT.
    2. Payload => Contain non-sensitive user data(e.g., a user id)
    3. Signature => Used to verify the token by the server.
If any of the above is changed then whole token is changed.
Server uses header and payload and hash them together using a secret string(only known to server) to create a signature string inside the server for mentioned user. The secret is only available inside the server and never ever sent back to the client. The JWT token is made out of these 3 parts and them sent back to client. This means, for a particular JWT token, if either of header or payload is changed to trick the server then server will deny such acts.

React-Router =>
    In normal websites, whenever a user requests for a page then this request goes to server and then server responds with HTML page as per request.
    In case of React, it only render single page and some JSX bundles along with it. Whenever user requests for page then React will not send this request to server, instead React will handle this request in client side only. Depending on the request, React renders specific component within the page. 

Loader Functions in React router =>
    These functions help us to load the component beforehand instead of loading them when they render. Normally we use useEffect hook for such cases.

Route Parameters =>
    Changeable section of router
    Some components shown for every variation
